# Smart-Auto-Prototype
Making the "auto" smarter.....in the nutshell <br>
(idk if this considered as A.I. or not, please tell me lol)
<br>

## Intro
### Goals:
<li> No more "Auto" gameplay with resources in order from start to finish
<li> "Auto" will check the enemies, check the resource you give, prioritizing, and attacking (4 States)
<li> death isn't punishing (in this example) because death increase your Attack point, but not your health
<li> "Auto" that can move forward, from your resources, and minimal death

### Notes:
I guess basic A.I. state machine from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaLD1t-kIwM is good enough so i need to learn this first, 

beside the one i currently making is a bit hard and long, hard, not-flexible, but almost-smart A.I., 

so let's compare that with the one i gonna make with A.I. State Machine
